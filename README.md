Test Steps
I've tested the program locally for extra information I've attached the screenshot of the test locally before I push the code to GitLab

Diagrams
Two diagrams will show you the stack of technologies that I used for the implementation.

CICD tool
This project has used the gitlab as main repository and CICD, which is why the files have wrotten in gitlab.yml
